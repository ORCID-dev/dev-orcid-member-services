# ORCID Member Portal

The ORCID Member Portal is a new suite of tools intended to help organizations make the most of their ORCID membership. This application is currently under development and has not yet been released.

The first phase of development includes features that simplify the process of posting affiliation information (employment, education, etc) to researchersâ€™ ORCID records.

Project tasks are managed in Trello:

## Start the discovery service

- Open a new terminal
- cd orcid-member-services/discovery-service/
- Run `bash mvnw`
- Wait for it to start
- Verify it has started properly. Go to http://localhost:8761/#/ and sign in with `admin`, password `admin`


## Start the user service

Our user service, based on [JHipster UAA](https://www.jhipster.tech/using-uaa/), is the service we use to secure our member services app. We also use it for all user based functionality.

> **IMPORTANT!** For running locally without an email server connected, disable mail health check for oauth2-services before starting. Edit [oauth2-service/src/main/resources/config/application.yml](https://github.com/ORCID/orcid-member-services/blob/master/oauth2-service/src/main/resources/config/application.yml#L60) and set health - mail - enabled to false.

- Open a new terminal
- cd orcid-member-services/user-service/
- Run `bash mvnw`
- Wait for it to start

## Start the gateway:

- Start MongoDB (e.g. `mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf --fork`)
- Open a new terminal
- cd orcid-member-services/gateway/
- Run `bash mvnw`
- Wait for it to start
- Go to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) and sign in with the admin credentials `admin / admin`

## Start the Angular frontend
- Open a new terminal 
- cd orcid-member-services/ui
- Run `ng serve`
- Wait for it to start

## Start the assertion service

- Open a new terminal
- cd orcid-member-services/assertion-service
- Run `bash mvnw`
- Wait for it to start

## Start the member service

- Open a new terminal
- cd orcid-member-services/member-service
- Run `bash mvnw`
- Wait for it to start

## Notes

- As long as the jhipster-registry is running first, the starting order of the other services is not important. They can also be started concurrently.

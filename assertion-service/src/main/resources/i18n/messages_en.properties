# notifications
assertion.notifications.intro=Why should you grant permission to make changes to your ORCID record? When you grant an organization you\u2019re affiliated with permission to write data (employment, education, etc.) to your record, it effectively signals to other systems that they have vouched for the fact that you are (or were) affiliated with them. When data in your ORCID record has been added by an organization you trust, you can be assured that it can be reused with a high degree of confidence in a number of different workflows, for example, when automatically filling out a growing number of manuscript submission or grant application forms.
assertion.notifications.subject={0} would like to add a validated affiliation to your ORCID record
